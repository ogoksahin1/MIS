 <h1> Project Proposal </h1>

 <p>My website will be about me and my life. I thought of it as a new way of introducing myself and what I do in my life. My aim for this website will be to provide a way for people to get to know me on a more personal level. It will provide the opportunity for the different audiences to read about my life, where I’ve been, what I liked and disliked and what my opinion is on those subjects. It is important because it is an online platform for people to get to know me. It is also important because it will provide an opportunity for me to be creative and imaginative about talking about my passions. </p>
<p>I plan to design the website as follows; 
<p>On one of the pages I plan to introduce myself informally and in a fun way. I will explain what I have done so far in my life, and what I plan to do as well as my hobbies and my interests. I will then provide a link (which will be the second level of the page) to my resume, which will help me to be known on a different level. It will also provide a way for potential businesses that I will apply to see what I’ve done as a student. </p>
<p> I will then include a second page about where I am from, which is Istanbul Turkey. I will be talking about the places that I like to go there, and the places that people who visit Istanbul must see. I will try to make the content as interesting and fun as possible. I will make the commentary so that it is from my perspective which would make it more personal.</p>
<p>For the third page, I will talk about my life in Boston and what I like doing here. I will talk about how it is different from my life in Istanbul. I will also include places that I like to go as well as new fun ideas to do in Boston. </p>
<p>The fourth and final page will be about some of the places I have visited, where I went and what I liked and did not like about them. </p> 
<p>I did not want to do a website that could be associated with a travel blog because I wanted it to be slightly different. That’s why I thought of making it a personal website to include my commentary. It will speak to different audiences. I will provide a link to this website on my resume so that potential businesses can see and learn more about me. It will also speak to my friends and family who would enjoy reading about my thoughts and ideas. And finally, it can also attract people who are interested to learn more about Istanbul, Boston, or any of the other places that I’ve been. </p>
<p>The purpose of this website is not commercial, it is personal.
